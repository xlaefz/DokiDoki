MVVM architecture

App aimed to make animated stories. Could not complete animation due to Lottie pod conflicts.
I feel like this app can become marketable and set itself unique if the animations were complete 
because it can potentially be a snapchat clone but for animated drawn stories. It can be marketed through more drawing tools/longer stories.
